# Config

This repository contains some of my commonly used configurations.

## Versions
Because programs such as tmux and nvim (especially nvim plugins) change often,
these configurations may not work for future releases. This configuration was
tested on Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS, with the following application versions:

 * nvim v0.8.3
 * tmux 3.2a
